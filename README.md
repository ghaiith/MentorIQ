## Introduction

MentorIQ is developed as part of the Google Solutions Challenge, with the goal of promoting programming education and enhancing the learning process for students and developers. It offers a user-friendly interface for learners to explore different programming domains and follow specific learning paths according to their interests and goals.

The platform also includes an admin dashboard (dash.py) to manage and monitor user data, courses, and progress.

## Features

- Comprehensive learning paths for different programming domains.
- User-friendly interface and easy navigation.
- High-quality tutorials and courses curated by industry experts.
- Hands-on projects and quizzes for practical learning.
- Community support and collaboration opportunities.
- Admin dashboard for managing user data and courses.

## Getting Started
